# Capstone of IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
This contains the capstone I created for the certification. The dataset used for this excercise was taken from a kaggle competition. [Kaggle Home Credit Default risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)

The goal of the notebook was to get a good machine learning model that maximized the Area under the Reciver Operating Charcteristic. 
The Notebook contains data visualization, feature engineering, model selection from tree-based algorithms and finaly parameter optimization phase looking at the Feature Importances of the the dataset. 

Prefered viewing would be on [Google Colab](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) as there are some files that would only load through the channel.
