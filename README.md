# Capstone of IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
This contains the capstone I created for the certification. The dataset used for this excercise was taken from a kaggle competition. [Kaggle Home Credit Default risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)

The goal of the notebook was to get a good machine learning model that maximized the Area under the Reciver Operating Charcteristic. 
The Notebook contains data visualization, feature engineering, model selection from tree-based algorithms and finaly parameter optimization phase looking at the Feature Importances of the the dataset. 

Prefered viewing would be on [Google Colab](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) as there are some files that would only load through the channel. If you want to run the note book you must first download the data sets that can be obtained through [my google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OBw2XyxxcdSinI7mV19MoEyATnSb5Dny). You must also be able to connect your own google drive with the notebook.
